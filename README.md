Various tweaks to improve the gaming experience in Linux

This is especially useful to launch automatically when you run a (Steam) game by adding it to the game's "Launch Options" in Steam -- right-click the game in the library list, click "Properties", click "Set Launch Options...".

eg:

`$HOME/bin/linux_gaming_tweaks.sh start; %command%; $HOME/bin/linux_gaming_tweaks.sh stop`.

Make sure to `chmod +x linux_gaming_tweaks.sh` before you try that.
